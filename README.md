# Luminous
We are team Luminous. 
This is our Mission Space Lab project with which we are participating.
The role of our project is to take pictures using the Picamera and to calculate, each time an image has been taken, the certain location of the ISS.
The coordinates regarding the images will be saved in an EXIF file. 
After each time an image will be captured it will be sent to a machine learning model to be classified.
The scope of the experiment was to detect urbanized areas, however with the test data we received we were able to train the model to detect clouds,water, earth, twilight and night.
We had fun doing it and it was a really nice experience.
